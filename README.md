# Quadratic Rough Heston

We implement the hybrid simulation scheme from the paper Quadratic Rough Heston available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=???. 

We provide easy-to-follow Jupyter notebooks in R and Python that show how to simulate and use the quadratic rough Heston (QR Heston) model.

- `Forward variance curve construction.ipynb` shows how to construct the forward variance curve from implied volatility data.

- `QR Heston simulation.ipynb` simulates the QR Heston model and plots SPX and VIX smiles, reproducing Figures 1 and 2 of the paper.

- `QR Heston SSR.ipynb` shows how to compute the SSR, reproducing Figure 3 of the paper.
