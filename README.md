# Quadratic Rough Heston

We implement the hybrid simulation scheme from the paper Quadratic Rough Heston available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=???.  In addition, we show how to compute the skew-stickiness ratio (SSR) and construct the forward variance curve from data.

We provide easy-to-follow Jupyter notebooks (using the R-kernel) that show how implement the  quadratic rough Heston (QRH) model.
